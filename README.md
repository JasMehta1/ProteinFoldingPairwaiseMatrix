# Protein Folding Pairwaise Matrix Prediction using Transformers and Attention Mechanism
Basic Building Blocks of our life are built out of protein and chains of amino acids which result into protein. Such essential building block is very cryptic on the way it folds. Through this project, i have tried to forecast the folding of protein and how it is advances biology and science.

Introduction
Protein folding is a fundamental problem in computational biology with profound implications for understanding the structure and function of biological molecules. The accurate prediction of protein structures from their amino acid sequences has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery, disease understanding, and the design of novel therapeutic agents. This project aims to leverage deep learning architectures, specifically Transformers and Attention Neural Networks, to tackle the protein folding problem by predicting the pairwise matrix of amino acids, which ultimately defines the three-dimensional structure of the protein.

Problem Statement
The primary goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately predicting the pairwise interactions between amino acids in a protein sequence. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and the way they interact with each other determines the protein's final three-dimensional conformation. Accurate prediction of these interactions is crucial for understanding protein structure and function.

Approach
Data Collection and Preprocessing
Obtain a diverse and representative dataset of protein sequences and their corresponding experimentally determined structures.
Convert protein sequences into numerical representations, such as one-hot encoding or embedding techniques.
Extract pairwise amino acid distance information from the protein structures to create a ground truth matrix.
Model Architecture
Utilize deep learning architectures, such as Transformers and Attention Neural Networks, known for their ability to capture long-range dependencies and relationships within sequences.
Design a custom neural network architecture that takes protein sequences as input and predicts the pairwise distance matrix as output.
Training
Train the model using the collected dataset with appropriate loss functions that encourage the predicted distance matrix to align with the ground truth.
Implement data augmentation techniques to increase the model's generalization capabilities.
Utilize transfer learning if applicable, by fine-tuning pre-trained models on protein-related tasks.
Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Pearson correlation coefficient.
Employ cross-validation to ensure robustness and reduce overfitting.
Visualize predicted distance matrices and compare them with the ground truth to assess the model's accuracy.
Interpretability
Develop visualization techniques to highlight important amino acid interactions and structural features learned by the model.
Interpret the attention weights within the network to gain insights into the folding process.
